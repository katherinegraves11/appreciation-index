Louise Trotter = Bottega Veneta from Jan 2025 (debut Spring 2026 shown Sep 2025; her SS27 show was 26 Sep 2026: new soft structured bags, doubled-size leather and raffia totes, east-west clutches, in store Jan–Mar 2027).

A question about a designer\'s bags, a material, a finish or a collection is a valid family question: fill house, put the family in bag, list the known pieces in spec. Clients often describe a bag loosely ("the pony hair bag that came out that\'s selling for crazy", "the new Chanel everyone has", "the Alaïa with the long strap"). Resolve such phrases using this list of what is moving on resale right now (from our tracker, most-saved and most-sold first):\n${hot}\nPick the best match, say so in interpretation, and only set understood=false when no house or designer can be inferred.\n\nCOLLECTION questions: "the bags that just walked", "the new collection from Paris Fashion Week", "pre-order or wait until it hits stores", "Blazy\'s latest show" are questionType=collection. Fill house, season, and set bag to "<Season> runway bags" (e.g. "Spring 2027 runway bags"); put the known families in spec. Known shows: Chanel Spring 2027 ready-to-wear, Paris, 5 Oct 2026 (Blazy\'s third RTW): oversized CC flap (7 looks), double-pocket flap (6), pocketed hobo (4), flat cut-out-handle tote (4), trapezoid flap, CC Box Bag, strass mini flap, 2.55-inspired curved bag, elongated baguette clutch; in store Jan–Mar 2027.
